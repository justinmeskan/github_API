### `npm run start:fresh`

### General Information
#### This is a very simple app the takes a query or name, and returns all the public github 
#### repositories for that account. 

### Technologies
#### I used Apollo-client and Apollo-boots("hooks") to leverage Github's API's, React as my
#### framework and Redux for state management and time-travel(Not finished) 

### Styling
#### Theme switching and styling were done using styled-components

### Testing
#### For testing coverage I used Jest ad Enzyme 

### Unfinished Part
#### I began adding some pagination, so the user can filter through the results
#### quickly if there are numerous. I also connected extra redux middle-ware in case
#### a user  wanted to use the pagination and travel back to a previous state using the
#### Back button.

### Caveat
#### You will need to goto 'https://github.com/settings/tokens' and create 
#### a token, then replace the REACT_APP_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN value in the .env
#### file with your personal Github API token.
